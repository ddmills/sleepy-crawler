## Impressions

The way characters view eachother is measured by three attributes (impressions):

1. Mistrust <---> Trust
2. Resent <---> Admire
3. Fear <---> Charmed 

These impressions can be changed through the following means:

1. *Intrinsic traits*. Gnomes are naturally trusting of strangers.
2. *Effects*. A love potion can increase admiration for the target.
3. *Actions*. Physically harming someone will cause them to resent you.
